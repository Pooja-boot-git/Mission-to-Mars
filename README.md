# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to create a web page that scraps Mars related data from other scraping friendly sites. We have created a stop website that shows all important details on Mars and we can pull new data whenever we want.

## Tools & Technologies 
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Mongo DB

## Libraries Used 
- **Beautiful Soup**: to read the html data and use that on our webpage.
- **Splinter**: allowing us to automatically browse through web pages without any manual intervention
- **Bootstrap**: provided us with custom stylesheet to use on our webpage.
